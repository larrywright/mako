This is a basic template for a sinatra application. It gives you a basic structure, default gems, and some javascript and css

This exists because I need a way to try out ideas quickly. I frequently come up with ideas for little apps that I might want to build. I want to be able to try building something quickly, with minimal setup time. That's what Ratpack does. It gives me a basic sinatra setup with some good looking html and css to let me get from crazy idea to prototype in a hurry. 

The building blocks are:

"Mongomapper":http://example.com Mongomapper (and of course MongoDB) are the easiest way to store data. No need to mess with migrations. Even if MongoDB isn't the right database to deploy a producion app on (though it may very well be), it's the fastest way to prototype one. You can always switch to PostgreSQL later on.

"Skeleton":http://www.getskeleton.com/ a "Beautiful Boilerplate for Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Development" which gives me a structure that will look good on anything from an iPhone all the way up to a large display.

"Inputs":http://pigment.github.com/inputs/ Nicely styled inputs. It may be a prototype, but theres no reason it can't look pretty.

"JQuery":http://jquery.org Best darn Javascript framework around

"JQueryUI":JQuery eye candy
